The objective of the project is to develop my own timer for the [pomodoro technique]. The project will be hosted through a page here on github, so it shouldn't be developed with any backend technologies. To be quite honest, there are already dozens of these timers, but I just wanted to put this together for the exercise.

Current Features
----------------
* Handles a variety of different lengths in timers.
* Provides an interface for handling the timer.
* Renders the timer in both text and meter.
* Plays a sound when the timer has finished.
* Records the timestamps and data of each session.
* Updates the title of page to also display the timer.
* Supports most (if not all) of the primary browsers.
* Remains responsive across different dimensions.

Eventual Features
-----------------
* Implements a few keyboard shortcuts.
* Gives prompts as the timer is almost finished.
* Pops up notifications when the timer has finished.
